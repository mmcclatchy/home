    "bio1": `Computers have always been a part of my life. I started building them when I was 10 years old and my fascination only grew from there. In high school, I sought out engineering competitions and either started a club to pursue them or worked on my own. I also taught myself AutoCAD during study halls and other spare moments that I could find. As a young adult, I loved working in IT due to the problem solving that I was challenged by on a regular basis.`,
    
    "bio2": `My trajectory shifted to a more inward journey where I studied psychology, massage therapy, and eventually Five Element Acupuncture. My focus was on self-awareness and emotional intelligence, working to bring myself and others to a life with fewer entanglements and an ease of being. It was here that I also became passionate about understanding what true leadership is and how that differs from authority.`,
    
    "bio3": `Eventually I realized that as much as I love Acupuncture, I am at my best in a team environment and after some time as a Customer Service Manager, I put together a list of qualities that I shine in and worked to find a career that checked them all off. That is when I discovered my absolute love of software engineering. I signed up to attend App Academy and I could not have made a better choice to empower me towards the pursuit of this passion in which I am truly dedicated.`,
